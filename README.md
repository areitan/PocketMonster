Create a QR for a Dungeons and Dragons Monster

## User Story

```
[AS A] Dungeon Master 
[I WANT] to easily generate a Dungeons and Dragons 5e monster 
[SO THAT] I can send it to my players
[GIVEN] I enter the attributes I would like the monster to have 
[WHEN] I click the search button 
[THEN] I am directed to a page with the monster's stats and a QR code that links back to the monster's page.
```
## Project Description
---
On pageload, the user will be presented with project title (PocketMonster), brief description of its function (maybe a snippet of background on D&D?), and a form with dropdown boxes for monster selection criteria.

Upon submission of the form, the user will be directed to a new page with a monster statblock (layout designed by us), and a QR code that links to the original statblock hosted on the API.
